          <h2>Narendranath Datta</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Swami Vivekananda, known in his pre-monastic life as Narendra Nath Datta
             was born in an affluent family in Kolkata on 12 January 1863. His father, Vishwanath Datta
            was a successful attorney with interests in a wide range of subjects, and his mother
            Bhuvaneshwari Devi, was endowed with deep devotion, strong character and other qualities.
            A precocious boy, Narendra excelled in music, gymnastics and studies. By the time he graduated 
            from Calcutta University, he had acquired a vast knowledge of different subjects, especially Western 
            philosophy and history. Born with a yogic temperament, he used to practise meditation even from his
            boyhood, and was associated with Brahmo Movement for some time.
